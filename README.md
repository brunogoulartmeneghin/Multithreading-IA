# Multithreading-IA

## Overview
  This project is basically an idea that I took as an opportunity to challenge myself on learning Python.
Putting in words, after studying about IA during college I came to known the high complexity of these kinds 
of algorithms, so to lessen the complexity and keep performance I thought in this approach I name "Multithreading Specialists".

  In "Multithreading Specialists" approach, I use less complex trainning based algorithms to execute in Threads and access concurrently the dataset (by doing this I can exploit the advantages of multicores architectures).
